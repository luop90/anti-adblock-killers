# Anti Adblock Killer
Various TamperMonkey scripts I've created to counter anti-adblockers.

## To Use
1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) for Chrome
2. Browse the scripts/ directory
3. Click "view raw" on any site you need, Tampermonkey _should_ automatically recognize the script.

## About
I create these as I see sites that try to detect my adblock. Usually the best course of action is to disable inline-scripts in [uBlock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), but I like the challenge of disabling them with a script.
